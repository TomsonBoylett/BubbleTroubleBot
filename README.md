# BubbleTroubleBot

Inspired by the bubble trouble flash game from my youth, I created a simple game where you as the player need to move a box left and right to avoid being hit by loads of bouncing balls.

I then created a method for automatically moving the player to avoid these obstacles.

The result can be viewed at https://tomsonboylett.github.io/BubbleTroubleBot/
